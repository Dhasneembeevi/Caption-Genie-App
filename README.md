The **Image Caption Generator** is a Python-based application that uses the pre-trained BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining) model from Hugging Face to generate descriptive captions for images. It features a user-friendly graphical interface built with `tkinter`, allowing users to upload images, view them within the application, and instantly receive a caption describing the content of the image.
The application supports popular image formats such as PNG, JPG, and JPEG, ensuring compatibility with most image files. It leverages the BLIP model's state-of-the-art capabilities to provide accurate and meaningful captions. Additionally, the app automatically resizes images for display, offering a consistent and visually appealing user experience.

To use the application, users simply click the "Upload Image" button, select an image file, and the app generates a caption based on the content of the uploaded image. The caption, along with the resized image, is displayed within the GUI. This straightforward process makes it easy for users of all levels to utilize advanced AI-based image captioning.

The project is implemented using Python, with libraries such as `transformers` for the BLIP model, `Pillow` for image processing, and `tkinter` for the GUI. To set up the application, users can clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the script. This tool is ideal for generating descriptive captions for images in various use cases, such as social media content, accessibility tools, and creative projects. Future enhancements could include batch image captioning, caption export options, and cloud storage integration.
